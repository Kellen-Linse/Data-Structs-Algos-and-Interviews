# How to Solve Coding Problems

#### Cheatsheet:
  - [Link](./Resources/Solving_cheatsheet.pdf)

#### Overview

- At the end of the day, an interview is a way for a company to find out whether or not you can solve a problem that the company or employer has. If you are able to solve their problems, then you are valuable to them. 

- Even if you memorize all of the data structures and algorithms, it doesn't guarantee that you will succeed in a technical interview.
  - You need to show that you have the other skills too.
    - Communication
    - Clean and readable code
    - Knowing the trade offs between different data structures and algos
    - etc...

- This section is meant to show how to solve coding problems in a way that companies want to see in a coding interview.
- The interview is not to see if you memeorized the data structures and algos, it is to see if you actually **know** them.

#### What are Companies Looking For?

- Analytics Skills
  - Your thought process.
  - They want to hear how you go from not knowing the answer, to solving the problem.
- Coding Skills
  - Do you code well?
  - Is your code clean, well organized, and readable?
- Technical Skills
  - Do you know the fundamentals?
  - Do you know the pros and cons of different solutions?
- Communication Skills
  - Does your personality match the companies personality?
  - Can you communicate well with others and work within a team?
<br>

- Companies are looking for people who know how to look for answers, and people who know their data structures and algos, and know when to use them.
- At the end of the day, companies want smart people.
- **Understand the *WHY* of doing things**

#### What We Need for Coding Interviews:

- **Data Structures:**
  - Arrays
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Linked Lists
  - Trees
  - Tries
  - Graphs
  - Hashtables
  - 
<br>

- **Algorithms:**
  - Sorting
  - Dynamic Programming 
  - BFS & DFS (Searching)
  - Recursion
<br>

- There are far more data structures and algos out there, but there are the ones that will show up most in interviews.
- **These are the base line skills**
- A lot of what is tested on in coding interviews is not used on the job day to day, but companies use these as metrics to see whether or not a candidate is capable of working hard for the interview and learning difficult material and is smart enough to solve the coding problems you will face in the interview.
  - **If you can solve these hard coding interview problems, you can solve easier problems on the job.**
<br>

- **Companies are looking for candidates who know data structures and algorithms. When/why to use them, and know how best to solve problems with them.  Candidates who know how to write code that is readable, memory efficient, time efficient, and can communicate how they arrived at their solutions in an understandable way.**

### Notes on an Interview at Google Video:

<br>

- Clarifications
- Think Out Loud
- Talk Through the Problem
- Talk Before You Write
- Test Yor Solution

### Exercise: Interview Question

- Understand the Problem
- Solve the Problem in a Naive Way
- Understanding why The First Solution is Not the Best Way
- Start to Think About Possible Better Solutions
- Once You Have Come Up with a Good Solution, Ask: How Can I Break This?
