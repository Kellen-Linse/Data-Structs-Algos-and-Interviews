# Pattern: Sliding Window

- In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the subarrays (or sublists) of a given size. 

## Array Problems:

- Two Sum Sorted
  - Two pointer

- Two Sum unsorted 
  - Two Pointer

- ThreeSum and Variants

- Threesum no duplicates:
  - Turn problem into two sum called multiple times
