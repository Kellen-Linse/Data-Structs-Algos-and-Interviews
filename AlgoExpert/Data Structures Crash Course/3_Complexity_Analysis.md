# Complexity Analysis

- It's very common for many coding problems to have multiple solutions
- **Complexity Analysis allows us to differentiate between these solutions to determine which is the best**
<br>

> The most notorious question in a technical interview: **Can you do better??**
<br>

- Complexity does not mean how "complicated it is," it refers to "time complexity" and "space complexity."
  - **Time Complexity:** how fast a given algorithm runs.
    - The faster then better.
  - **Space Complexity:** how much space a given algorithm takes up.
    - The less space it takes, then better.

> Usually, to improve time complexity you have to sacrifice space complexity, and vice versa.
