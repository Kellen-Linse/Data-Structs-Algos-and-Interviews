# Problem Solving Ability

- At it's core, software development *is* problem solving.
  - Often ambiguous and complex problems.
  - Could be high level, could be technical. 
- **Software developer interviews are really assessing your problem solving ability.**
  - Algorithm interviews tend to be a good way of assessing problem solving ability.
<br>

- **As the interviewee we need to convey that we have these good problem solving abilities.**

## 5 Things Interviewers Can Do to Convey that They are Good Problem Solvers.

- Some of these tips will overlap with tips given in other videos, such as communication, because they are all interrelated. 
<br>

##### 1. Eliminate Ambiguity 

  - On the job you are often given ambiguous problems.
    - You need to show that you can handle it.
  - Often it will feel like the problem is clear, but there is often hidden abiguity you need to unravel. 
<br>

- **Eliminate abiguity by asking clarifying questions, at the beginning and through out the interview.**
  - "What kind of input should I got?"
  - "Should I consider edge cases?"
  - "Is it ok if I use methods built in to JS?"
  - "Is it ok if I make this assumption?"

- **There is no worse signal you can give than jumping into a problem without asking any questions.**
<br>

##### 2. Take Some Time to Discover the Problem

- What you **don't** want to do is read the problem, then immediately jump into coding the solution.
  - That tells your interviewer you don't take time to fully understand the problem, and that you don't consider other possible solutions.
<br>

- **Explore the problem!**
  - Find and separate different sub-problems.
<br>

- When you take your time to consider the problem,
  - You can consider alternative solutions, and weigh the pros and cons of your solution.
  - You can watch out for repetition in your solution and optimize.
  - You can consider what type of data structure will work best for you.
<br>

##### 3. Discuss Trade Offs

- **There is almost always more than one way to solve a problem.**
- When you come up with a solution you should **always discuss the tradeoffs, or pros and cons of that solution.**
  - Ex:
    - "I'm going to solve this problem using recursion, and these are the benefits and downsides of doing so vs iteration."
      - good: It's clean and doesn't take many lines of code.
      - bad: It's not very intuitive or easy to understand at a glace.
  - Ex: 
    - "There are a lot of repeated steps in this solution, maybe we could implement memoization or caching."
      - good: This allows for a much faster run time.
      - bad: This solution uses extra memory.
<br>

##### 4. Implementing or Tackling the Problem in an Organized Manner

- Sometimes it is better to not start from the very beginning.
  - Maybe you need to do something like define a class or helper methods.
<br>

- **Sometimes it makes sense to "false define" a helper function, leaving the actual definition blank, but then using the function within your main problem and discuss what that function should do.**
  - "We are going to assume this is written out and use it in our main problem."
    - **Is that ok?**
<br>

- It is important to prove that it is organized, at least to you, and explaining your method of organization to your interviewer will clarify that.
<br>


##### 5. Test Proactively

- **Don't** let your interviewer ask about how confident you are or how you would test it.
- **Mention testing BEFORE your interviewer does.**
<br>

- Explain and express how you would **rigorously** test this solution will help convey that you are a good problem solver.
  - Ex:
    - "Here are the edge cases I would test for..."
    - "Here is the suite of things I would test for..."
    - "If we were given this more complex input this is what we would have to test for..."

- **Showing that you are capable of thinking about testing and are able to come up with rigorous tests is very important.**
