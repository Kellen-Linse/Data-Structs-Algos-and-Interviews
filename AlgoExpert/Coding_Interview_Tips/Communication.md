# Communication

> **Communication can make or break you in a coding interview.**
<br>

- Most software developers only program ~25/30 percent of the time.
  - The rest of the time they are communicating about code.
<br>

- **Communication is easy to access in a 45 minute interview.**
  - Your actual coding skills may not be so easy to access in that same 45 minutes, so showing off strong communication skills is very important.
<br>

### 4 Categories Of Communication To Be Aware Of:

#### 1. Eliminating Ambiguity

  - Some problems are **purposely ambiguous.**
    - This is don't to see if you can communicate to eliminate that ambiguity.
    - **Ask questions at the beginning of your prompt to clarify.**
    - Don't be afraid to as clarifying questions through out the interview.
<br>

#### 2. Voicing Your Thought Process

  - Voice anything you identify.
  - **The point of the interview is to show the interviewer your ability to think through a problem.**
  - Helps the interviewer follow what you're doing.
  - **You don't want the interviewer inferring or guessing what you're doing.**
  - Interviewers will probably **NOT** give you the benefit of the doubt.
  - Speaking through your logic will help you clarify your logic, and may give your interviewer opportunities to help you.
<br>

#### 3. Discussing Trade Offs

  - You must **discuss trade offs** of different possible solutions.
    - Ex:
      - overhead vs. simplification
  - Explain your ideas, give your interviewer the opportunity to get involved in a positive way.
  - You can find out hidden requirements that may not have been in the prompt, but you need to consider.
    - Ex:
      - whether or not you are allowed to mutate a given array.
<br>

#### 4. Proactively Asking for Approval or Help from Your Interviewer

- Don't allow your interviewer to guess why you did something.
  - Ex:
    - Asking to shorten a variable name in order to save time in the interview.
      - Explaining why you are doing that.
      - Getting approval to do so.
  - Ex:
    - Asking to not flush out a helper method.
      - Explain what it does, but in order to save time, not flushing it out.
  - Ex:
    - You're stuck.
      - Speak to how you got to where you are, voice your thought process.
        - put the ball in the interviewers hands to help/ get then involved.

### Final thoughts

  - Don't over do any of these.
  - **You don't have to talk every single second of the interview**
  - **Filter what you are saying. Don't blurt out everything you say.**
<br>

- **Being a great communicator can put you over the bar.**
