# How to Optimize Your Use of AlgoExpert

## Getting Started

- Figure out how much time you have until your interview.
  - Ideally 1 to 4 months
<br>

- Your goal in using AlgoExpert is to **get better at coding interviews**.
  - Subgoal: **do as many questions as possible in a way that you absorb them, and retain how to solve them.**
  - Be able to answer these, or variations of these questions **in an interview setting.**
<br>

## Choosing Which Questions to do First

### Approach #1 (recommended): In Order of Difficulty

- Following a logical order and building on themselves.

### Approach #2: By Category:

- Use this approach if you have large differences in your strengths or you have only a small amount of time. 
- Best to still do some in all categories.

### Notes on Categories:

- Many questions utilize multiple categories, so take the category grouping with a grain of salt. 

## How to Approach Solving the Questions:

- If you are in the **first half** of your interview prep, **don't time yourself.**
  - Within reason. Give yourself some cap, so you're not wasting your time or spinning your wheels. (2 hrs).
  - **Struggling with the problem is important.**
  - **It is very important to have the patterns and the logic of the algorithm click in your mind.**
  - **You need to be familiar with the nuances of the problem, and there is no way to get there other than to struggle with the problem!**
<br>

- Timing:
  - First Half: **none**.
  - Second Half: **35-40 minutes**.

### Hints

- On any given problem there are 3-4 hints.
<br>

- Hints are blurred to begin with and only one hint at a time will be unblurred.
  - This is to represent they way hints are given in a real interview setting.
  - In a real interview you may only be given a hint after 10 minutes.
- **Only look at them one at a time.**
- **Only look at them in the order they are given on the page. (smallest hints are first).**
- **Only look at any given hint ~10 minutes after starting or receiving your last hint.**
- **Try to minimize the amount of hints you use. (Sometimes it is needed or expected, but try to use as little as possible.**

### Running Your Code

- This is super useful, but it is **not something you will have in a real interview setting.**

### Recommendation:

- **Run your code as much as you want in the first half of your prep.**
- Only run your code **once or twice** once you think you have the solution in the second half.
  - Your goal should be to pass all of the test cases the first time you hit that run button.
  - Your interviewer will ask you **are you satisfied with this?**
    - What that means is **if I were to give you a whole bunch of premade test cases would you pass this?**
- Towards your interview date, **do not look at the raw output**, if you fail, **you should be able to find your error without looking at that.**
<br>

- Start your first **15-20 minutes** solving the problem **using a whiteboard.**
  - Hashing out how you're going to solve it and possibly writing pseudocode. 
<br>

- Test cases are blurred in the workspaces, because **you are the one who has to come up with your own test cases.**
  - Test cases can give you a very big hint.
- Ideally, you should try to catch the errors that you have **before looking at the edge cases.**

### Checking the Optimal Time and Space 

- **ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS run through a space and time complexity analysis once your test cases are passing.**
- **You will be asked this in an interview** and you must get in the habit of doing that. 
<br>

- Once you have determined what the T&S complexity of your algorithm is, then look at the optimal T&S for the problem.
  - **Compare** against your T&S
    - If it is worse, either:
      - You got your T&S wrong.
      - There is a more optimal solution.
        - If so keep working your solution to see if you can match this.


### Syntax Highlighting

- This may be a luxury you do not have in your interview. 

### Looking at the Solutions

- Don't look until you have solved yourself, or only if you are really, really stuck.
<br>

- There are **written solutions** and a **video solution.**
- The video solution will be the more in depth option.
- **Always watch the video.**
<br>

- Use **!** to mark questions you struggled on, and go back to them.

## Final Points

- Before your interview, go back and skim problems.
- Don't skip the easy ones.
- **If you can't do the easy questions in an interview, you're probably not in good shape!**
- There are a lot of solutions for individual problems.
  - Sometimes it is objectively better, but many times it is subjective.
- **If you can answer all or most of the questions on AlgoExpert, you are well prepared for the interview.**
