# Whiteboard Random Notes

### Problem Solving 

- For every problem, fully flush out the algos and data structures BEFORE writing code.

- Make sure you are explaining the WHY as well as the HOW when talking about the solution.

- Create a template/structure and follow it for every problem.

- If you are having an issue coming up with a solution, try working backward from the solution. What does the solution look like as it is being built?

- Try to add one sentence about the brute force even if you know how to solve it optimally.

### Todo's and notes on taking notes

- Make a note for each problem pattern, "Common data structures and algos used with ___" 

- Write one sentence about each problem's solution (like neetcode google doc).

- Look at similarities within problems within a pattern.
  - What makes one problem "hard" and one problem "easy"?

- Break down the prompts, is there a relationship between the prompt and how hard the problem is?
