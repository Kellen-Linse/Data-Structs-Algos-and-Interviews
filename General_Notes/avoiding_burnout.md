### Interview Prep Burnout is Real

  - Interview prep can take months 
  - For top level companies, their interview process is designed to weed out all but the best.
  - Getting a job at a top company requires both breath and depth of knowledge, of coding skills and CS fundamentals.
    - Also, soft skills.
  - Candidates must meet requirements and beat out competition.
  - **This can all be overwhelming, and it is easy to experience fatigue**

### 9 Ways to stay motivated and avoid burnout:

#### 1. Understand the Interview Process

  - Because top tech companies interview so many, they utilize a generalized process of interviewing rather than assessing candidates on personal strengths. 
  - By focusing on the right knowledge areas vs. trying to cover an exhaustive list of topics, you can close knowledge gaps and gain the expertise you need to succeed at the interview without getting overwhelmed and burnt out.
  - **Use a FOCUSED APPROACH**
  - Companies often provide candidates resources to get insights on the right knowledge areas and skills they are looking for. 
  - You can also request recruiters for information on a company’s interview process. 

#### 2. Study Interview Experiences of Other Candidates

  - Check places like Leetcode's interview discussion section, glassdoor's interview section, and hired's discussion section to find real world interview experiences with a certain company.

#### 3. One Step at a Time

  - Adopt a slow and steady approach to your preparation. 
  - Organize your preparation process.
    - Pick and choose what you will study and when you will study it.
  - Define what is most important ahead of time.
  - Prioritize your tasks, get the most important tasks done first.
  - Identify goals and set milestones BEFORE diving in.

#### 4. MANAGE YOUR PREP TIME:

  - Managing your prep time is key to keeping you from getting fatigued and derailed.
  - Understand the time commitments of your prep process.
    - Create a structured preparation plan with these time constraints in mind. 
  - Build coding capabilities and gain expertise
    - You will be expected to solve complex problems in a short amount of time.
    - Build your problem-solving capabilities slowly to ensure you develop strong conceptual knowledge and gain expertise. 
    - Move from simple to difficult problems over time.
  - Steady progress will help with feeling bogged down and overwhelmed.
  - **Follow a schedule**
    - This will help keep you from getting distracted and procrastinating.

#### 5. Take Breaks

  - Schedule breaks and **stick to them.**
  - If you’re having trouble with specific knowledge areas or skills, taking a break will help clear your mind. This can help you refocus, making it easier to work on difficult topics. 
  - This means go for a walk or do some light chores, **not indulgent breaks like video games**.
  - Don’t waste your time if you find yourself stuck at any time during your preparation process. Move on to the next step and return to resolve the issue later. This will help you cover more ground and prevent you from getting bogged down by difficult topics.

#### 6. Create a Vision Board

  - **Keep a constant reminder of your why**.
  - To stay enthused about your preparation process, write down what you aim to achieve at the end of it, why you decided to interview at a new company, and the benefits of landing a job offer from the company of your choice.
  - This will act as a constant reminder of your preparation objectives and keep you motivated to plough on through all challenges.

#### 7. Enjoy the Process

  - Connect your why to the process.
  - **Developing or enhancing fundamental computer skills, knowledge and behaviors will not only help you perform well and get through a technical or coding interview but will help you become a better engineer.**
  - You can create interest in the process by understanding and aligning the long-lasting benefits of a new job to your process of upskilling. 

#### 8. Utilize Online Resources

  - Online resources can help you shape your time and focus your energies into the correct places to get the most out of your prep.

#### 9. Set Realistic Expectations

  - Technical interviews at FAANG and Tier 1 tech companies require dedicated preparation and commitment. Staying motivated is key to ensuring you stay the course to succeed in interviews and land an offer from the company of your choice. 
  - Always have a choice of companies to work with instead of focusing on one company alone. Prepare to interview with multiple companies to avoid giving up if rejected by one company.
