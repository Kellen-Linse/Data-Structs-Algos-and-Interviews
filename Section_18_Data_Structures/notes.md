## 104: Which data structure is the best?

> Data Structure: **Collections of values**, the **relationships** among them, and the **functions** or operations that can be applied to the data.

- Why so many? 
  - Difference data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized and others (like arrays and objects) are more generalized.

- Why care?
  - The more time you spend as a developer, them more likely you are to need to use one of these data structures.
    - Each has it's time and it's place.
    - You have probably already worked with many of these data structures without knowing already.
    - **Interviews**

- There is no "One Best" data structure.


## 105 through 108, Class Syntax: 

> Class: a blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods.
  - *These classes are actually syntactic sugar over JS's existing prototype based inheritance model.*

- Classes are what we use to implement our data structures.
- Class names conventionally start with a capital letter.

- Instance Methods: 
  - Provides functionality that pertains to a single instance of a class.
- Class Methods, and the **static** keyword:
  - The `static` keyword defines a static method for a class. Static methods are called without instantiating their class and cannot be called through a class instance. Static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application.
  - Not related to an individual instance.
